# OnePlus 3 MultiROM Setup Documentation

## Proposed Configuration
- Oxygen OS (base OS)
- LineageOS 15 
- LineageOS 14.1
- CyanogenMod 13
- Kali NetHunter (maybe)
- MIUI 8
- Flyme 6


## Resetting OnePlus 3 to Stock State
1. Download latest version of Oxygen OS from [OnePlus](http://downloads.oneplus.net/) (as of this writing it's 4.1.7)
1. Reboot into recovery by holding power and volume down as the phone boots.
1. Choose the "Install from USB" option in OnePlus Recovery
1. Run the following in terminal on your computer: `adb sideload /path/to/OxygenOS/zip`
1. Allow the phone to reinstall the OS and reboot. Most parts of setup can be skipped since we will be wiping this again soon.
